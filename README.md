# Marcador

Engine to make text highlights with persistence (like in medium.com) easy and configurable.

This gem is highly inspired by [acts_as_content_highlightable](https://github.com/kbravi/acts_as_content_highlightable), but using a more modern approach ( importmap, es6, migrations on engine, etc).
